## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# we can see that from the dataset, 1961 is the most wet year. There are 16 times in average in this year has heary rainfall from each storm. And 1962 and 1964 are also wetter than other years. 1963 and 1960 are the dryer years. And I think wet years are wet because there were more storms in these year. 


#After we done the analysis part, I think we should focus more on the reasons of heary rainfall and do some research of it.

#What I have done in this project and the future plan.

#My coding skills are not good from the begining of our program. However, I think I had a improvement after this whole year learning. Although it's not good enough than other classmates, right now I can finish a thorough project by myself. In this project, I do face a lot of problems. Each line of codes have some bugs in the beginning, but I Googled it and get solved it in the end. For the plan of future work is continue to learn and practice coding skills and try to be a good data analyst.
